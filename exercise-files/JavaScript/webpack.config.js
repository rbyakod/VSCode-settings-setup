/**
 * webpack Configuration
 *
 * Working of a webpack can be very simple or complex. This is an internally simple
 * build configuration.
 *
 * webpack basics â€” If you are new the webpack here's all you need to know:
 *     1. webpack is a module bundler. It bundles different JS modules together.
 *     2. It needs and entry point and an output to process file(s) and bundle them.
 *     3. By default it only understands common JavaScript but you can make it
 *        understand other formats by way of adding a webpack loader.
 *     4. In the file below you will find an entry point, an output, and a babel-loader
 *        that tests all .js files excluding the ones in node_modules to process the
 *        ESNext and make it compatible with older browsers i.e. it converts the
 *        ESNext (new standards of JavaScript) into old JavaScript through a loader
 *        by Babel.
